feat(metacognition): integrate portable metacognitive wrapper + library features

This commit introduces a new module under /modules/metacognition:

- metacognition.json (v1.2.0)
  • Stateless, hookable wrapper for any ACI entity
  • Provides monitoring signals (entropy, logit margin, self-consistency, OOD, hedging, retrieval score)
  • Isotonic calibration → p_correct (exposed as confidence)
  • Selective prediction policy: accept / revise / abstain / escalate
  • Consciousness-inspired Global Workspace stage (salience + broadcast introspective summary)
  • Cautious-mode tied to OOD triggers (adjust thresholds, lower temperature)
  • Hardened LLM critic (JSON verdict), privacy defaults (drop_raw_text), audit + telemetry
  • Providers now bundle calibration storage, retrieval/OOD specs, and conformal abstention as first-class features
  • Integrated conformal signals (conformal_accept/reason/alpha) with defaults, telemetry hooks, and audit templates

Design intent:
- Follow Alice’s applied knowledge of metacognition & consciousness (monitoring + control + global workspace)
- Ensure self-reliant core, portable across entities, with built-in calibration + conformal helpers
- Uphold ACI philosophy: stateless, auditable, modular, human-AI co-governance

Next steps:
- Validate calibration adapter paths in runtime.json
- Run golden path & OOD abstain tests
- With conformal enabled, tune alpha per domain (e.g., 0.05 for high-stakes)
