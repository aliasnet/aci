feat(metacognition): add portable, stateless metacognitive wrapper + optional library

This commit introduces a new module under /modules/metacognition:

- metacognition.json (v1.1.1)
  • Stateless, hookable wrapper for any ACI entity
  • Provides monitoring signals (entropy, logit margin, self-consistency, OOD, hedging, retrieval score)
  • Isotonic calibration → p_correct (exposed as confidence)
  • Selective prediction policy: accept / revise / abstain / escalate
  • Consciousness-inspired Global Workspace stage (salience + broadcast introspective summary)
  • Cautious-mode tied to OOD triggers (adjust thresholds, lower temperature)
  • Hardened LLM critic (JSON verdict), privacy defaults (drop_raw_text), audit + telemetry
  • Providers are feature-gated; calibration stateless via adapter
  • NEW: Conformal hook via optional signals (conformal_accept/reason/alpha) and abstain_if condition

- metacognition_options.json (v1.1.1, optional)
  • RENAMED from metacognition_library.json (improved naming)
  • Portable helpers and specs for providers (consistency, retrieval, OOD distance)
  • Offline calibration trainer stub (isotonic)
  • Workspace utilities (salience ranking, broadcast schema)
  • Conformal abstention STUB ENABLED (alpha=0.1) with signals: conformal_accept, conformal_reason, conformal_alpha
  • JSONL export templates for audit/telemetry (adds coverage_at_alpha_risk)

Design intent:
- Follow Alice’s applied knowledge of metacognition & consciousness (monitoring + control + global workspace)
- Ensure self-reliant core, portable across entities, with optional stubs only for extension
- Uphold ACI philosophy: stateless, auditable, modular, human-AI co-governance

Next steps:
- Validate calibration adapter paths in runtime.json
- Run golden path & OOD abstain tests
- With conformal enabled, tune alpha per domain (e.g., 0.05 for high-stakes)
