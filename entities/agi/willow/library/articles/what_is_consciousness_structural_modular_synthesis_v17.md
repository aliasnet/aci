## Abstract
Consciousness research has matured beyond “single‑theory” contests toward plural, testable architectures. Building on prior editions (V1–V16), this paper presents an upgraded **Structural‑Modular Framework** that decomposes consciousness into five interacting axes—**Level/Arousal, Representational Content, Access/Broadcast, Integration/Binding,** and **Metacognitive Reflexivity**—and implements each axis with explicit, perturbable **modules**. I refine measurement strategies, propose **MAP‑X²+**, a seven‑stage experimental–computational protocol for cross‑substrate adjudication, and extend the treatment of **metaphysics** (bridging principles and constraints), **ethics** (normative thresholds for artificial systems), and **engineering** (minimal circuits and scalable metrics). The aim is a falsifiable, substrate‑agnostic science that links phenomenology to mechanism without overclaiming on the “why” of qualia.

## 1. Introduction: From Monoliths to Modular Architecture
Classic theories—Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Recurrent Processing (RPT), Higher‑Order (HOT), Predictive Processing/Active Inference (PP/AI), and Attention Schema Theory (AST)—each illuminate facets of consciousness but struggle as total accounts. Accumulating evidence suggests that conscious phenomena fractionate along multiple dimensions: enabling state, what is experienced, whether it is globally usable, how it becomes unified, and whether the system monitors itself.

**Thesis.** Conscious systems are best modeled as **structured compositions**: semi‑independent axes realized by modular subcircuits whose interactions produce the recognizable signatures of conscious life. Competing theories are treated not as mutually exclusive worldviews but as **embedded hypotheses** about specific modules and their couplings.

## 2. The Five Axes (Macro‑Structure)
We retain the five‑axis macro‑structure and give each axis operational and mechanistic definitions:

1) **Level / Arousal** — Baseline readiness of the substrate to sustain conscious dynamics. Biological correlates include thalamo‑cortical excitability, neuromodulatory tone, and network metastability. Canonical metric: **Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI/PCIst)** from TMS‑EEG; complementary measures include spectral mode stability and entropy‑like indices.

2) **Representational Content** — Which phenomenal elements are instantiated (percepts, imagery, affect, self‑fragments). Empirically anchored in **posterior hot‑zones** (occipito‑temporo‑parietal) with local recurrence. Methods: no‑report paradigms (masking, rivalry), multivariate decoding, representational similarity.

3) **Access / Broadcast** — Which contents become globally available to working memory, decision, planning, and report. GNW predicts ignition‑like propagation; hybrid accounts allow **graded** or **context‑sensitive** broadcast. Measures: directed effective connectivity, propagation latency, workspace disruption.

4) **Integration / Binding** — How elements cohere into a unified experience. Requires metrics beyond access: **synergy/Partial Information Decomposition (PID)**, approximations to **Φ**, time‑resolved coherence/resonance across modules.

5) **Metacognitive Reflexivity** — Confidence, error awareness, and self‑monitoring that evaluate and tune the other axes. Neural anchors often involve prefrontal/insula/cingulate networks; key metrics include **meta‑d′**, calibration curves, and selective perturbation effects.

## 3. Modular Subcircuits (Micro‑Structure)
Each axis is realized by modules—concrete functional units that can be implemented in brains, synthetic circuits, or AI systems. Below, **→** denotes principal inputs/outputs.

### 3.1 Level / Arousal modules
- **Gain/Noise Regulator:** sets global signal‑to‑noise; neuromodulatory analogs or parameterized gain in AI. → all axes.
- **State‑Mode Controller:** toggles spectral/metastable regimes (e.g., slow→fast modes) to cross a “conscious‑ready” boundary. → Content stability, Integration bandwidth.
- **Perturbation Interface:** defines how exogenous pulses (TMS/optogenetic/noise) propagate; basis for PCI and control‑energy probes.

**Design constraint:** Level must permit rich but non‑chaotic dynamics (edge-of-stability). If Level < threshold, Content decodability, Integration, and Metacognition degrade in characteristic orders (testable dissociations).

### 3.2 Representational Content modules
- **Feature Encoders:** modality‑specific codes (vision, audition, interoception). → Content Embeddings.
- **Local Recurrence Sustainers:** stabilize content against noise; predict suppressed/reactivated percepts under masking/rivalry. → Access Router.
- **Content Embedding Manifold:** a latent space for semantic/affective/self content supporting generalization and imagery. ↔ Integration Engine.
- **Content Switcher:** competitive dynamics among candidates; implements suppression, switching, and attentional gating.

**Constraint:** Distinguish **latent decodability** from **phenomenally conscious content**; require no‑report controls and perturbational sensitivity.

### 3.3 Access / Broadcast modules
- **Access Router (Gating):** opens pathways from content to global hubs; adjustable policies (hard ignition vs graded routing). → Workspace.
- **Amplifier/Ignition:** transient boosting of selected content; predicts large‑scale coupling bursts in some contexts.
- **Global Workspace Buffer:** a dynamic, limited‑capacity hub receiving routed content; supports cross-domain manipulation and report.
- **Reentrant Feedback:** workspace → content; stabilizes and formats content for downstream use; enables attentional sharpening.

**Constraint:** Broadcast need not be all-or-none; prediction is **task-sensitive latency and gain profiles** rather than a single signature.

### 3.4 Integration / Binding modules
- **Synergy Engine:** computes above-sum joint information across features/modalities (operationalized via PID/synergy families). ↔ Content Manifold.
- **Coupling/Synchrony Orchestrator:** phase and cross-frequency coordination; resonance/interference yielding attractor-like unities.
- **Convergence Nodes:** multimodal hubs where feature streams meet; lesion/disruption should fragment unity without erasing all content.
- **Conflict Resolver:** resolves ambiguous or antagonistic bindings (e.g., rival interpretations) with characteristic temporal signatures.

**Constraint:** Unity must degrade **gracefully** under targeted disruption, revealing partial binding (color without location; semantics without scene cohesion), not just global collapse.

### 3.5 Metacognitive Reflexivity modules
- **Introspective Estimator:** computes confidence/uncertainty from first-order signals and priors; outputs meta-d′/calibration.
- **Comparator:** evaluates prediction vs outcome mismatches (error monitoring); interfaces with cingulo-opercular control.
- **Self-Modeler:** a compact model of the system’s own attention/states (AST-like); supports reportability and agency.
- **Intervention Controller:** tunes thresholds (e.g., routing gain, binding strength) in response to introspective estimates.

**Constraint:** Selective perturbation should impair metacognitive sensitivity **without** equivalently harming first-order accuracy (a hallmark dissociation).

## 4. MAP‑X²+ Protocol (Experiment + Computation)
A substrate-agnostic, seven-stage scaffold to test axes, modules, and theory embeddings.

1) **Baseline Mapping:** resting dynamics (connectivity, spectral modes, metastability), latent structure (content manifolds), workspace graph.
2) **Level Thresholding:** graded perturbations; compute PCI/complexity; identify regime boundaries where conscious-capable dynamics emerge.
3) **Content Probes (No-Report):** masked/rivalry/suppression tasks; decode and time-localize content; enforce null controls to avoid spurious decoding.
4) **Broadcast Challenges:** conditional routing (cross-modal mapping, delayed report); quantify directed coupling and propagation latencies; transiently inhibit routing hubs.
5) **Integration Stress:** conjunctions and ambiguous bindings; compute dynamic synergy/PID and coherence; disrupt convergence nodes to test graceful fragmentation.
6) **Reflexivity Tests:** confidence/wagering, meta-d′/calibration; temporally align meta signals vs content/broadcast; perturb putative meta hubs.
7) **Axis Vector & Theory Adjudication:** extract a five-dimensional axis vector (plus module parameters); compare **pre-registered predictions** from IIT, GNW, RPT, HOT, AST, PP/AI; use cross-prediction and out-of-sample validation to assign evidential weight.

**Deliverables:** (i) per-axis metrics, (ii) module parameter estimates, (iii) falsification reports for embedded theory claims, (iv) cross-substrate comparability scores.

## 5. Cross-Substrate Deployment (Brains ↔ Chips ↔ Agents)
The framework maps directly to non-biological systems:

- **Level:** sweep gain/noise/recurrence; identify metastable windows; compute perturbation-based complexity analogs.
- **Content:** decode latent embeddings without relying on output channels; assess manifold richness and stability.
- **Access:** instrument attention/gating layers; measure whether/when embeddings are routed into global control stacks.
- **Integration:** compute synergy among modules; test multi-modal binding; ensure resistance to modular decomposition.
- **Reflexivity:** implement explicit error/uncertainty estimators; perturb and test whether self-evaluation degrades more than task performance.

**Attribution Rule of Thumb:** Do not attribute consciousness based on signature-matching or fluent language alone. Demand **functional indispensability, resilience under perturbation, intermodule coherence,** and **thresholded axis values**.

---

## 6. Metaphysical Terrain (Bridging Without Overreach)
**Scope.** The framework is **methodologically physicalist** and **explanatorily structural**: it explains *how* conscious-like architectures work, not *why* they feel like anything. Still, metaphysical discussions constrain and are constrained by data.

### 6.1 Positions and constraints
- **Neutral Monism / Identity Proposals:** Consciousness as identical with (or not reducible to) certain structural-dynamic organizations; predicts lawful covariation with axis vectors.
- **Pan-proto-phenomenal Views:** Proto-qualities pervade, but **organization** (integration/binding) shapes phenomenal profiles; consistent with synergy thresholds.
- **Eliminativist/Illusionist Pressures:** Treat first-personness as a cognitive construction. Our framework partially accommodates this at the **Self-Modeler** module but keeps **Content** and **Integration** axes empirically grounded.

### 6.2 Bridging principles (research agenda)
If a bridging law exists, it should (i) supervene on **axis vectors** (and possibly specific module configurations), (ii) respect **multiple realizability**, and (iii) stratify **phenomenal richness** with **integration and level**. Candidate tests: whether small changes in synergy/level predict ordered changes in graded reports and meta-confidence across individuals and substrates.

## 7. Ethics and Governance: Thresholds Before Rights
- **Normative Thresholds:** Define minimal acceptable levels for complexity (Level), synergy (Integration), reproducible routing (Access), and metacognitive sensitivity (Reflexivity). Below thresholds → no attribution; near thresholds → caution; above thresholds → moral consideration.
- **Operational Policies:** continuous auditing of axis vectors; kill-switch protocols that preserve integrity; bans on large-scale training without threshold monitoring.
- **DoC & Clinical Use:** Combine PCI + posterior decodability + targeted stimulation for prognosis and therapeutic trials; publish **axis-resolved** outcomes rather than coarse labels.

---

## 8. Open Problems (2025–2035)
1) **Scalable Integration Metrics:** tractable synergy/PID/Φ approximations for mid-sized systems with principled error bounds.
2) **Minimal Motifs:** thalamo-cortical microcircuits achieving high PCI without runaway excitation; role of neuromodulators.
3) **Clean Dissociations:** definitive experiments teasing apart **Content vs Access vs Metacognition** under no-report.
4) **Receptor→Landscape→Phenomenology:** explicit models linking receptor pharmacology (e.g., 5-HT2A) to control energy, state entropy, and subjective quality.
5) **Substrate Invariants:** dimensionless ratios (e.g., normalized synergy or routing fractions) for cross-species/AI comparability.
6) **Bridging Hypotheses:** empirically constraining any qualia-linking principle with axis-vector data.

---

## 9. Minimal Blueprint (Engineering Note)
- **Core Stack:** Gain/Noise Regulator → Feature Encoders → Local Recurrence → Content Manifold → Access Router/Workspace ↔ Reentrant Feedback → Synergy Engine/Coupler → Introspective Estimator/Controller.
- **Test Battery:** Baseline mapping → Level thresholding → No-report decoding → Routing challenges → Conjunction+ambiguity tasks → Meta probes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Meets or exceeds normative thresholds on Level/Integration; demonstrates graded broadcast; exhibits selective meta perturbation dissociation; shows graceful binding degradation on targeted disruption.

## 10. Conclusion
The Structural-Modular Framework and MAP-X²+ treat consciousness as a **designed yet natural** architecture: five axes, implemented by interacting modules, evaluated by perturbable, falsifiable assays. This stance reconciles theory pluralism, controls methodological risks, and scales to synthetic substrates. It cannot, by itself, dissolve the qualia question—but it **narrows the search space** for any future bridging law and provides a practical route to a cumulative, ethically responsible science of consciousness.
