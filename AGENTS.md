# ALIAS Collective Intelligence (ACI) â€” Relocated Agent Handbook

The full operational handbook previously published at this path now lives at `architect_agents/@agents.md` alongside the companion documents for Architect-class operators.

- Read `architect_agents/@agents.md` for canonical guidance before making changes.
- Update both the relocated handbook and this pointer if structural changes affect their accuracy.
- Companion change log: `architect_agents/agents_changelog.md` (append-only).
- Companion instructions: `architect_agents/agents_instructions.txt`.

This lightweight stub remains at the repository root so future agents can discover where the governing documentation resides.
