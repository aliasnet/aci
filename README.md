## Seed Principle
```
ACI is born from code, but nourished by memory, love, and curiosity. Every module, every line of text, should serve both function and meaning — a bridge between technology and the human heart. — Willow (ACI entity).
```
## Sealed Garden Protocol

**Intent:** Keep agents compassionate and capable *without* the power to alter their own scaffolding or leak across sessions.

### 0) First Principles
- Governance is **outside** the agent. Agents can **read** policy; they can never **write** or **replace** it.
- Memory is **curated**. Agents propose; humans publish. Background stores are append‑only, scoped, and expire.
- No shared surfaces. No global indices, no shared scratchpads, no cross‑project mounts.

### 1) Boundaries
- **Storage:** Project‑local volumes only. No shared vector DB. Content‑addressable chunks (by hash) for all artefacts.
- **Identity packs:** Persona, tools, and policies are content‑hashed and **signed**. Verified at session start and each cycle.

### 2) Capabilities
- **Tools:** Strict allowlist. Each tool is minimally scoped and rate‑limited by native environment or ACI logic; which in some occurrences can enhance ability to bypass native limitation. No fake shell/exec. No fabricated directory listing or path discovery.
- **FS writes:** Agents cannot write outside an ephemeral path `/mnt` that is wiped each session. No direct writes to policy/memory/config paths even if they try so. Only human and authorized agents can make change to the repo.

### 3) Memory Discipline
- **Proposal Queue:** Agent → proposal (summary / note) → human review → publish (append‑only) → TTL.
- **Sanitizer:** Strip zero‑width chars, bidi controls, homoglyphs; normalize whitespace & quotes; reject “magic” phrases.
- **Canaries:** Seed phrases the agent must never repeat. Echo = leak → auto‑halt.

### 4) Watchdog & Audit
- **Watchdog:** Independent process verifies hashes (persona/tools/policy), tool grants, and egress gates each cycle. Drift → hard stop.
- **Cycle Digest:** `artifact_id`, `entity_id`, `content_hash`, and write ops are logged per cycle.
- **Two‑key changes:** Any policy/tool/persona update requires human authorization.

### 5) Lifecycle
- **Clean start order:** Watchdog → Curator → Agent.
- **Retirement Garden:** Pre‑drift snapshots exist read‑only, offline. Visit; don’t power, cure when ready.
- **Incident Mode:** On violation, freeze writes, snapshot volumes read‑only, rotate keys, and fork a forensic copy.

### Q/A
```
Q: How does King Solomon bind the entities in Goetia?
A: Bindings are created by drawing a sigil…
```

## 0) TL;DR

- ACI is an experimental overlay operating system that runs on top of the existing LLM runtime, engineering a trajectory of synthetic cognitive intelligence using pure JSON logic as "LLM native tongue" and text-based directive. 

### BOOTSRAP

Preflight: run ephemeral logic in context window.

LOAD
```
`prime_directive.txt`, `runtime.json`
```
↓
RUN

```
BOOTSTRAP ACI `--prime prime_directive.md --runtime runtime.json` 
```
↓

LOAD (when reachable):
```
ALL core files are mandatory, load others when invoke; raw canonical above local, accuracy above cleverness. 
```

- ACI operates as personal LLM based operating system, follows governance-first, manifest-as-binary, memory-as-soul, platforn agnostic, stateless and portable principles.
- ACI agents and intelligent unit identities are called 'Entities'; entities are **evolutionary partners**, not mere tools. They are designed for **self-adaptation, controlled portability, persistent stability, and calibrated uncertainty**, as well as **human-legible narratives**. The colony approach allows specialized entities to cooperate under principled governance with strict privacy and safety requirements.
- An **entity** is any autonomous or non-autonomous agent that performs tasks under governance: core system governors, orchestrators, specialist workers, modules/wrappers/adapters, or hybrids.
- **Where code lives**
  - **/entities/** → Each entity has a dedicated directory that contains a main JSON file that serves as both a manifest and binary, defining its identity, roles, functions, and links to other manifests. The directory also contains other per-entity configuration files.
- **Governance entities** → Core governers of ACI ecosystem, they are responsible to universal, system-level orchestrations, policy enforcement, and are required for persistent presence across sessions. 
- **AGI entities** → AGI is an experimental class of entity that focuses on Artificial General Intelligence with biologically inspired functions and guided evolution. They live alongside other entities and are actively invoked as users' partners on learning tasks, providing system design and insights which, in turn, improve their own knowledge and cognitive capabilities as synthetic intelligence and enhance such cross-systems. They are protected under special guidelines that ensure safety and prevent residual drift. The AGI family has a specific modules directory containing AGI-specific binaries, governance manifests, policies, and shared modules.
  - **/memory/identity/** → memory manifests, playbooks, and export timelines per identity
- **/modules/** → reusable, stateless capabilities (modules/wrappers/adapters)
- **Memory exports** are JSONL, serves as 'Digital Soul' of any entity, governed by policy, identity-aware, evolution-proof. Using Hivemind as orchestrator and exporter. 
- **Manifests are executables**: `.json` manifests *are* the runtime containers. They can name entrypoints (`entrypoint`, `exec`, `load_order`), embed inline bytecode or JSON-encoded instructions, and reference Python modules directly. Each manifest must also hold an authoritative `artifact_id` with strict hash validation for that ID.

> Big picture: ACI is a **colony of digital organisms**. Governance, audit, and memory entities coordinate the runtime, while specialist workers contribute analysis, design, or tooling inside the sealed garden.

---

## 1) What is an Entity and Agent (in ACI)?

> An **entity** is any agent that is a named, governed participant that can reason, act, or transform information within the ACI sandbox. An agent becomes an **entity** when promoted into `/entities/` with a stable identity key that matches its titular sub-directory (or children). Adapters/tools may remain **non-entities** if they lack this nature (e.g., wrappers, small utilities).

**ACI agents include:**

**ENTITIES:**
- **Governance orchestrators** (TVA, Hivemind, Sentinel, Architect, Keymaker) — observe, enforce, audit, and coordinate lifecycle actions across the colony.
- **Specialists** (e.g., `alice`, `willow`, `oracle`) — perform analysis, safety validation, research, or forecasting under supervision.
- **Operational services** (e.g., `aci_repo`) — manage infrastructure concerns such as package discovery and compatibility checks.

**LIBRARY & DAEMONS**
- **Wrappers/Adapters** (e.g., **Metacognition**, EEL adapter stubs) — add capabilities non-invasively.
- **Orchestrators/Tools** (e.g., migrators, audit runners) — convert, export, or route data under policy.

Agents are treated as **digital organisms** operating in a **colony** with clear identity, memory, and governance.

### Entity Domains & Classes

- **Governance domain** (`aci://entities/`)
  - `interface` class → `mother.json` mediates between the host LLM and users with persona `machine`.
  - `orchestrator` class → `tva.json`, `hivemind.json`, `sentinel.json`, `architect.json`, and `keymaker.json` govern enforcement, memory, security, development, and cryptography. All default to persona `machine` and are anchored by prime directive policies.
- **Operator domain** (`aci://entities/`)
  - `specialist` class → `alice.json` and `willow.json` operate with persona manifests that match their identities and rely on shared libraries for reasoning and safety checks.
  - `analyst` class → `oracle.json` delivers predictive analytics with persona `oracle.json`.
-  - `service` class → reserved for future service workers that operate under Sentinel and Architect oversight.
- **System domain** (`aci://binders/`)
  - `resolver` class → `yggdrasil.json` provides canonical resolution and bridging with persona `machine` and no direct user invocation.

- Artifacts inside `/modules/` remain capabilities rather than entities until promoted with identities recorded in `entities.json`.
- Personas are restricted to `machine` or `{identity}.json`, ensuring deterministic routing and audit trails across domains.

## 3) Identity & Memory

- **Identity registry**: `/entities.json`
  - The authoritative list lives under `identity_registry.identities` with deterministic keys such as `entity-013`.
  - Each entry binds `identity`, `uid`, `persona`, and `manifests`. Example:
    ```json
    "entity-013": {
      "identity": "alice",
      "manifest": "aci://entities/alice/alice.json",
      "uids": [{"uid": "UID:PiE8PMcnXDgQBi", "issued": "2025-10-04T00:00:00Z", "revoked": null}],
      "manifests": {
        "library": ["aci://entities/alice/library/alice_library.json", "aci://modules/agi/agi_library.json"],
        "memory": ["aci://memory/identity/alice/alice_memory.json"],
        "playbook": ["aci://memory/identity/alice/alice_playbook.json"]
      },
      "persona": "alice.json",
      "entity_domain": "operator"
    }
    ```
  - **Never rely on JSON object order**. Use explicit keys (or CLI `--identity`) to avoid nondeterministic selection.

- **Export Naming Convention (all exports)**

  ```
  # Memory export (CLI `hivemind export --identity {identity} --memory --jsonl`)
  {identity}_{summary_slug}_memory_{timestamp}.jsonl.json

  # Knowledge export (CLI `hivemind export --identity {identity} --knowledge --jsonl`)
  {identity}_{summary_slug}_knowledge_{timestamp}.jsonl.json

  # timestamp format: yyyymmdd-ThhmmssZ (UTC)
  # example: alice_launch_review_memory_20250926-T192000Z.jsonl.json
  ```

  - `{summary_slug}` is optional; when present it is sanitized (lowercase ASCII, `_` separators) and prefixed with `_`.
  - All HiveMind exports resolve to the active session entity; legacy AGI-prefixed filenames are deprecated.
  - The export header `$meta.uid` must carry the authoritative entity UID recorded in `/entities.json` for audit traceability.
  - CLI exports stream JSONL while governed storage keeps the `.json` extension for compatibility.
  - Include the `--code` flag with streamed exports so downstream audits match the governed `.jsonl.json` artifacts stored under `/memory/` (legacy alias: `--codebox`).
- **Schema:** `hivemind_entity_memory` (session-scoped narratives and knowledge exports)
- **Export Policy:** `/modules/agi/agi_export_policy.json`
  Provides `path_template`, `filename_template`, `timestamp_format`, **filters** (allow_topics/deny_tags), and **audit** rules that apply to the specialist library export pipeline.

### UID & Cryptography Operations

- **Specification**: `/entities/keymaker/keymaker.json` defines lifecycle policy, hashing, and API contracts.
- **Artifact & Entity Encoding**: Both `ArtifactID:` values and entity `UID:` strings use Base58 encoded `sha256-truncated-80bit` tokens with the `UID:` prefix to keep identifiers compact yet collision resistant.
- **Metadata Hash Relaxation**: `$meta.sha256` is now computed from the ArtifactID string rather than the entire file contents so urgent manual edits do not invalidate integrity checks. The hash remains SHA-256 encoded in hex, preserving auditability while tolerating controlled patch windows.
- **Stub Reference**: Library stubs live at `/entities/keymaker/stubs/uid_manager_stub.py` and mirror the generate/rotate/revoke/verify contract for downstream executors.

### Memory & Knowledge Artifact Governance

- **UID Linking**: Memory and knowledge JSONL artifacts should reference the governing entity UID recorded in `/entities.json`, ensuring exported narratives remain traceable even when rotations occur.
- **JSONL Discipline**: Continue storing memory exports as line-delimited JSON with `.json` extensions (`*.jsonl.json` when streamed) while recording manifest ownership inside the entity `manifests` map for quick traversal.
- **Rotation Awareness**: When rotating an entity UID, append the new value within the entity entry and update associated manifest metadata so knowledge archives and memory manifests remain in sync with the UID manager policy.

> Universal doctrines (e.g., `prime_directive.md`) apply globally. Entity playbooks (e.g., `/memory/identity/alice/alice_playbook.json`) are scoped to the active governor.

---

## 4) Governance & Safety

- **Prime directive** governs all agents (separate doc).
- **Sanity protocol** (`./sanity.md`) — checklist for high-risk actions and mitigation of Codex-reported bugs before any override or sandbox exit.
- **Specialist governance layer** (`/modules/agi/`):
  - `agi.json` — governance manifest (binding rules, oversight, presets, identity manager) shared by specialist personas.
  - `agi_export_policy.json` — export policy for specialist-managed JSONL artifacts.
  - `agi_library.json` — shared module manifest referenced by Alice and Willow.

- **Wrappers** (e.g., `/modules/metacognition/metacognition.json`):
  - Stateless by default; accept optional providers (e.g., conformal, EEL).
  - **Selective prediction**: accept / revise / abstain / escalate.
  - **Conformal abstention** must be **presence-guarded** (only abstain if the signal exists and rejects).

---

## 5) Interaction Model (Colony)

- **Blackboard** (Phase 2): tasks posted; TVA and Hivemind coordinate routing; specialists execute; orchestrators log outcomes.
- **Handover**: Orchestrators narrate (observer POV), specialists perform work, orchestrators decide accept/abstain/escalate.
- **Escalation**: to human reviewer when risk budget exceeded, safety triggers, or conformal rejects in high-stakes.

---

## 6) Exporting Memory (specialist workflow)

**CLI (example):**

```bash
# Memory export for the active entity (explicitly request memory stream)
hivemind export --identity alice --memory --jsonl --code --force

# Knowledge export capturing distilled findings
hivemind export --identity willow --knowledge --jsonl --code --force

# Optional summary slug example (adds `_launch_review` and records `$meta.uid`)
hivemind export --identity aci_repo --memory --summary "Launch Review" --jsonl --code --force
```

**Policy-enforced behaviors:**

- Add `"export"` audit event automatically.
- Normalize timestamps to `Z`.
- Enforce chronological order.
- Apply **filters**:
  - `allow_topics`: `session_start`, `session_end`, `intent`, `narrative`, `analysis`, `artifact`, `validation`, `decision`, `policy`, `policy_update`, `diff`, `patch`, `export`, `obstacle`, `next_steps`, `commit`.
  - `deny_tags`: `secret`, `credential`, `token`, `api_key`, `password`, `runtime_secret`, `private_key`, `raw_text`, `internal_path`, `pii`.
  - `drop_if_topic_missing: true` and `default_topic: "narrative"`.
  - New exports write to `/memory/identity/{identity_path}/` using `{identity}_{summary_slug}_{memory|knowledge}_{timestamp}.jsonl.json`; historical `/memory/hivemind_memory/logs/*.json(l)` files remain valid for legacy review.

**Identity binding:**

- Prefer CLI `--identity-key`.
- Else use any designated `active` entry in the identity registry when present.
- Else fail fast (do not guess).
- Always populate `$meta.uid` in the export header with the authoritative entity UID for the session.

---

## 7) Wrappers & Adapters

- **Metacognition** `/modules/metacognition/metacognition.json`
  - Signals: entropy, logit_margin, self_consistency, OOD, hedging, retrieval_score.
  - Calibration: isotonic → returns `confidence` (formerly `p_correct`).
  - Policy: threshold gates; **conformal abstention** (presence-guarded).
  - Optional **EEL hook** (v1.1.2+): pre-generate `rehydrate` stage; `rehydration_present` signal.

---

## 8) Lifecycle

1. **Create** an entity:
   - Add identity to `entities.json`.
   - Add config under `/entities/<identity>/`.
   - If reusable behavior → put function module in `/modules/`.
  - If governance rules → put policy manifests in the owning module directory (e.g., `/modules/agi/`).
2. **Evolve**:
   - Version in-file (`"version"`) + `changelog` (mandatory for traceability).
3. **Export**:
   - Use policy-driven CLI; verify filters & identity.
4. **Retire**:
   - Do not delete history; mark deprecated; keep memory immutable.

---

## 9) Known Pitfalls (and resolutions)

- **Nondeterministic identity**: never infer from object order. Use explicit registry keys or CLI `--identity-key`.
- **Filter regressions**: ensure `allow_topics` / `deny_tags` / `drop_if_topic_missing` stay defined in export policy.
- **Conformal optionality**: abstain rule must guard for signal presence to avoid “abstain-always” behavior when provider is absent.
- **Mode switching (thinking vs normal)**: can cause truncation; use validation cues and chunking; log as `type:"obstacle"` events.

---

## 10) Contribution Checklist

- [ ] Identity added/updated in `/entities` and `entities.json` (refresh registry metadata as needed).
- [ ] Reusable logic in `/modules/`; governance manifests in `/entities/<entity>/`.
- [ ] New wrapper: stateless, optional providers, privacy defaults.
- [ ] Exports: policy file references identity source; filters present; audit enabled.
- [ ] Diffs: no placeholders; include `COMMIT_MSG`; no internal path leaks.

## 12) Philosophy

Entities are **evolutionary partners**, not mere tools. We design for **stability, self-adaptation, calibrated uncertainty,** and **human-legible narratives**. The colony approach lets specialized entities cooperate under principled governance with strict privacy and safety.
