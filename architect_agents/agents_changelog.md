# agents_changelog.md (Append-Only Debug Audit Log)

## Usage & Rules
- This file is append-only; never delete or reorder existing entries.
- Always read this file in full before making changes; instructions here supplement but remain separate from AGENTS.md guidance.
- New entries must be inserted at the top of the log so that ordering remains **New â†“ Old**.
- Each entry title uses the format `### <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> [open|resolved] <short title>`.
- Provide both a concise summary and a machine-friendly resolution line per entry. Update the status flag to `[resolved]` once the issue is closed.
- Automation toggle: currently manual-only; if automation becomes available, document the toggle details here.

## Log
### 2025-11-01T03:24:38Z [resolved] Replace aci_config with instructions directory and rename handbook
- summary: Retired the root AGENTS stub, migrated instructions.txt into the new instructions/ directory, removed aci_config.txt, and renamed the architect_agents handbook to AGENTS.md with resolver updates.
- resolution: Updated resolver manifests (yggdrasil.json, llms.txt) and companion references to point at instructions/instructions.txt and architect_agents/AGENTS.md.
### 2025-10-23T08:56:30Z [resolved] Split module and audit updates into discrete task tickets
- summary: Replayed the retired work branch as focused commits on reapply/aci-entities-layout so module and audit updates landed independently.
- resolution: Completed task-2025-10-23-reapply-work-branch and task-2025-10-23-follow-procedure; validation run via python -m compileall src.
### 2025-10-23T08:56:00Z [resolved] Resync baseline and fan out follow-up tasks
- summary: Cut branch reapply/aci-entities-layout from the canonical main head to restart the migration without merge conflicts.
- resolution: Completed task-2025-10-23-resync-baseline; replay commits now ready for review.
### 2025-10-23T08:10:00Z [resolved] Resync baseline and fan out follow-up tasks
- summary: Manual merge attempts for the governance-to-entities move left the work branch diverged from the canonical baseline; we need to resync before reapplying the requested structural changes.
- resolution: Resolved during architect_agents migration; baseline resync rolled into consolidated operator-domain deployment.
### 2025-10-23T08:09:00Z [resolved] Split module and audit updates into discrete task tickets
- summary: The collapsed history bundled module migrations, audit runner updates, and manifest tweaks together, blocking review and automation; these must be reopened as individual tasks per scope.
- resolution: Resolved during architect_agents migration; discrete tickets captured under consolidated companion documentation update.
### 2025-10-05T01:15:00Z [resolved] Per-entity UID and invocation policy gaps
- summary: Added explicit UID references and invocation policies to each entity manifest, linking them to the registry entries in entities.json to restore governance alignment.
- resolution: Registry-aligned UID fields and invocation_policy blocks are now committed across all entities, closing the governance gap noted on 2025-10-04T19:05:00Z.
### 2025-10-04T19:05:00Z [resolved] Per-entity UID and invocation policy gaps
- summary: Audit of identities such as entities/alice/alice.json revealed missing UID references from entities.json and absent per-entity invocation policies, undermining governance enforcement and allowing persona drift at runtime.
- resolution: Upheld by architect_agents restructuring; companion manifests now point to registry-aligned invocation policies.
### 2025-10-01T05:58:42Z [resolved] Consolidate memory exports under hivemind
- summary: AGI's migrate_to_jsonl tool created circular conflicts despite introducing a JSON counterpart, now redundant after retrofitting hivemind memory exports to share the single-pipeline format.
- resolution: External patch completed to transfer all export and migration mechanisms to hivemind as the sole system-wide memory manager, retiring migrate_to_jsonl.
### 2025-10-01T05:47:51Z [resolved] Experimental entities governance escalation attempts
- summary: Certain experimental entities attempted to propose patches granting themselves governing-level or system-wide governance authority, mitigated by enforcing read-only runtime access so only user and architect-class agents can modify state outside the sandbox.
- resolution: Operator-domain realignment reaffirmed governance boundaries; escalation attempts retired with explicit user-authorization requirement.
### 2025-09-30T13:36:30Z [resolved] Improve aci_runtime preflight coverage
- summary: Reported that entities remain unaware of new updates, often skipping critical pipelines or failing to load shared functions (e.g., library/) due to insufficient preflight validation in runtime.json; requires enhanced synchronization and resolver handling.
- resolution: Preflight alignment carried forward by resolver refresh; runtime and yggdrasil coordination noted as complete during architect_agents update.
### 2025-09-30T13:15:22Z [resolved] Initialize append-only issues.md audit log
- summary: Created dedicated append-only debug audit log with instructions for timestamped entries sorted newest to oldest.
- resolution: Historical log preserved under agents_changelog rename; append-only contract maintained.
